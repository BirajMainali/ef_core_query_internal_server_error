# HomeController

The `HomeController` in this project is designed to demonstrate and address issues related to using transaction scopes in Entity Framework Core (EF Core), particularly within the context of the ASP.NET Core framework. This README provides an overview of the controller's functionality and the purpose of its methods.

## Purpose

The purpose of the `HomeController` is to showcase different approaches to handling transactions and database operations within an ASP.NET Core application using EF Core. It specifically addresses scenarios where transaction scopes may lead to unexpected behavior or errors, such as internal server errors.

## Methods

### ReproduceInternalServerError

- **Endpoint:** `POST /HomeController/ReproduceInternalServerError`
- **Description:** This method reproduces an internal server error by using a transaction scope for the entire method. It attempts to create a new entity (or retrieve an existing one) and returns the result.
- **Outcome:** The method may throw an internal server error due to improper usage of the transaction scope.

### JustCreateWithRegularException

- **Endpoint:** `POST /HomeController/JustCreateWithRegularException`
- **Description:** This method demonstrates a better approach by using a transaction scope only for the necessary database operations. It handles exceptions appropriately and returns the result.
- **Outcome:** The method performs the desired database operations without encountering internal server errors.

### ResolveRegularAction

- **Endpoint:** `POST /HomeController/ResolveRegularAction`
- **Description:** This method provides a resolution to the issue by utilizing transaction scopes effectively. It creates or retrieves entities within a transaction scope limited to the required database operations.
- **Outcome:** The method successfully executes database operations without errors and returns the expected result.

## Supporting Methods

- `ResolveGetOrCreateAsync`: Handles the creation or retrieval of entities within a transaction scope, resolving potential concurrency issues.
- `ReproduceGetOrCreate`: Similar to `ResolveGetOrCreateAsync`, but reproduces the issue of using a transaction scope for the entire method.
- `CreateConcurrency`: Creates a new Concurrency entity to simulate concurrency-related scenarios.
- `CreateYoloAsync`: Creates a new Yolo entity and persists it to the database.

## Usage

To explore the functionality of the `HomeController`:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the application.
3. Send requests to the respective endpoints using an HTTP client or tool like Postman.
4. Review the responses and observe the behavior of each method.
